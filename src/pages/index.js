      <h1>👋 Hey there, I'm Lenny 🤓</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        👨🏽‍💻 Full-stack web developer. Lifelong learner. Currently into anything
        web: UI, backend and everything in between. 💻
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not on my day job 👨🏽‍💼 at Autodesk helping people{' '}
        <i>make anything</i> through software, I prepare workshop material 👨🏽‍🏫,
        and write articles on my <SafeLink name="blog" link="/blog" /> and on{' '}
        <SafeLink name="DEV" link="https://dev.to/lenmorld" />
        ✍🏽. Check out my contributions to open-source projects on{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/lenmorld">Github</a> and my regular (mostly
        on-and-off 😅) learnings on{' '}
        <SafeLink name="Twitter" link="https://twitter.com/lennythedev2" />. By
        the way, I'm also a mentor. Reach out via one of my socials 👇🏽 if you're
        interested.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently learning (context-switching 😏) between React, vanilla JS +
        HTML + CSS, Rails, and Node
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding (or reading about coding 📚), you can find me
        playing basketball 🏀 (missing a wide-open shot), gaming about
        basketball 🎮, guitar-ing 🎸 (taking forever to learn a song and
        eventually forgetting it), and swimming 🏊🏽‍♂️ (can hardly do a lap).
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe that it's all about the journey, not the destination ⛰. There
        are no limits to knowledge and our potential, so better cherish the
        learning 😊. I'd love for you to follow my journey as I carve my own
        path 🛣, but I'd love it even more to know about yours 🏆. Say hi and
        don't be a stranger! 👇🏽
